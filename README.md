Hi! This project is a unique blend of music and making social connections. It uses your Spotify data to match you with potential partners based on your music taste.

## How it Works 🛠️

Wavelength leverages the Spotify API to analyze your favorite genres and artists. It then uses this data to match you with other users who have similar music tastes. The result is a unique dating experience that's based on something we all love - music.

The project is built with Flask, a Python web framework, and uses SQLAlchemy for database interactions. The frontend is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
